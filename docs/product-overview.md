# Product Overview

## Key Features and Benefits

Arcube provides a REST API and widget to offer ancillaries like baggage protection, car rentals, eSIMs, and more — all with AI‑driven personalization.

## AI‑Powered Personalization
Arcube uses artificial intelligence to analyze passenger data and recommend the best ancillary products tailored to each traveler. By considering variables such as length of stay, destination, and local events during the trip, the AI ensures the offers are both relevant and valuable.

## Seamless Integration
Arcube has integrated dozens of ancillary products and supplier APIs into a single integration for travel providers. It’s designed for minimal engineering effort, low cost, and fast time‑to‑market. Whether you embed the widget/API in the booking flow or use the post‑booking email path that links to a white‑label website, the experience is smooth, efficient, and secure.

## Multi‑Channel Ancillary Distribution & POS
Arcube supports flexible, modular options for both pre‑ and post‑booking. “Tenants (Airlines, Travel Agents & Other Travel Providers) can use one, two, or all channels in parallel depending on journey design, tech capabilities, and time‑to‑market:

- **Widget integration**: Presents ancillary services seamlessly during the booking process to enhance the customer experience.
- **Email integration**: Sends personalized offers post‑booking to encourage advance purchases.
- **White‑label website (Point of Sale)**: Acts as the checkout destination from post‑booking emails so passengers can complete purchases.

## Revenue Generation
Arcube enables new revenue streams without in‑house sourcing, development, and maintenance of ancillary services. Providers can tap into growing demand, improving profit, engagement, and loyalty.

## Custom Branding and White‑Label Solutions
The white‑label website and email templates are customizable to match the provider’s brand, ensuring all ancillary interactions feel native to the customer experience.

## Compliance and Security
Arcube manages the legal and compliance aspects of selling ancillaries, including PCI DSS for payments. Sensitive data is handled by trusted PSPs to protect both businesses and passengers.

## Comprehensive Analytics
Detailed insights help providers track performance and optimize strategies — including ancillary mix, customer preferences, and overall revenue contribution.

## How Arcube Enhances the Customer Journey

Arcube doesn’t just increase ancillary sales — it improves the passenger experience by offering services they actually need or want. Personalized, well‑timed offers (during booking, via email, or on the white‑label site) make each touchpoint more helpful, building loyalty from booking through travel.
