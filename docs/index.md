## Introduction

### Overview of Arcube

Arcube is a cutting-edge third-party ancillary services platform designed to help travel-related businesses, including airlines, Travel Agents and Travel Management Companies (TMCs), and other travel service providers, unlock new revenue streams and enhance the passenger experience. By integrating personalized ancillary products such as baggage protection, car rentals, carbon offset, eSIMs, and more, Arcube offers a seamless way to provide value-added services at various stages of the passenger journey.

### Value Proposition

Arcube enables airlines, travel platforms, and TMCs to boost ancillary revenue by automatically recommending tailored offers (e.g. eSIM, airport transfers, lounge access) to their travelers during and after booking. The system uses AI to dynamically personalize these offers based on real-time trip context such as destination, travel dates, duration, local events, and weather,so you don’t need to build or maintain your own recommendation logic. Integration is lightweight, and Arcube handles offer optimization and merchandising on your behalf.


At Arcube, we have spent 3+ years aggregating dozens of ancillaries from hundreds of suppliers with extensive coverage across the world so that travel providers don’t have to.
For airlines, Arcube expands service offerings beyond the flight itself, covering crucial passenger journey stages such as booking confirmation email, pre-departure, post flight & return flight. This allows airlines to enhance their passengers’ travel experience while generating additional revenue.

 For TMCs, our platform enables them to offer a wider array of services to their corporate clients, further differentiating their service portfolio and improving satisfaction. Whether you are an airline, TMC, or other travel provider, Arcube’s platform helps you become a true one-stop shop for your customers’ travel needs, making their entire journey more enjoyable and convenient.


### Arcube Product Target Audience


Arcube’s solution is perfect for:

Airlines looking to broaden their service offerings and increase ancillary revenue through personalized, AI-driven recommendations.

Travel Management Companies (TMCs) seeking to enhance corporate travel services with tailored ancillary products that improve the travel experience for business travelers.

Travel Agencies and other travel service providers aiming to stand out in a competitive market by offering a wider selection of personalized services for customers.

By leveraging AI to recommend the most relevant ancillary services based on a variety of real-time factors, Arcube helps businesses in the travel industry boost revenue, improve customer engagement, and enhance overall service offerings.

## Overview of Integration Methods

Arcube offers three distinct integration methods for airlines, Travel Management Companies (TMCs), and other travel providers to seamlessly deliver personalized ancillary services to passengers: **Widget Integration**, **Email Integration**, **API Integration** and **White-Label Website (POS)**.

These methods are designed to be flexible, allowing businesses to choose the option that best fits their customer engagement strategy, or even use all three methods concurrently for maximum impact.

Additionally, Arcube customizes the look and feel of both the iFrame and white-label website to match the partner’s branding and visual identity.

## Choosing the Right Integration Method

Arcube’s four integration methods allow businesses to choose the solution that best fits their needs:

- **Widget Integration** – Ideal for embedding ancillary offers directly within the booking flow, providing a seamless and engaging experience during the booking process.  
- **Email Integration** – Best for post‑booking engagements, allowing airlines and TMCs to offer personalized ancillary products after the initial booking, thereby increasing revenue before the journey begins.  
- **API Integration** – Provides the most flexibility, enabling airlines, TMCs, and other travel service providers to integrate ancillary offerings at any touchpoint in their own systems, whether during booking, travel, or post‑trip.  
- **White‑Label Website Integration (POS)** – Provides a fully branded, dedicated Point of Sale where passengers can purchase ancillary services after receiving an offer from the email.  

There is no **better** or **worse** integration method — the more integration points a tenant implements, the more conversion opportunities they are likely to generate.  
The real question is **what is technically feasible** for the tenant, based on their technology stack, platform limitations, and integration capabilities.  

Having this in mind, Arcube has crafted a product that supports **a spectrum of integration approaches**, from **simple** to **advanced**, ensuring that every tenant can find the right fit for their technical environment and business objectives.

By using one or more of these integration methods, travel providers can maximize their ancillary revenue while delivering a personalized and seamless experience for their passengers.
