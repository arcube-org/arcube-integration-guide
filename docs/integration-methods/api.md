# API Integration (Direct Integration)

## Overview
The API Integration method gives airlines, TMCs, and other travel service providers the flexibility to integrate Arcube’s ancillary services **directly into their systems** via a RESTful API.  
This enables personalized ancillaries to be offered at **any stage of the customer journey** — pre‑booking, post‑booking, or during travel.

---

## How It Works
1. The airline or TMC integrates directly with **Arcube’s RESTful API**.
2. Relevant passenger and booking data is securely sent to Arcube.
3. Arcube processes the data in **real‑time** and returns a **personalized list of ancillary products** based on:

    - Trip details
    - Passenger preferences
    - AI‑powered recommendations

4. The airline or TMC uses this data to display ancillaries at any customer touchpoint:

    - Booking system
    - Mobile app
    - Web portal
    - Other customer interfaces

5. Payment can be handled:

    - **By the airline or TMC** via their own payment gateway
    - **By Arcube** using its integrated payment solution

## Customization of Look and Feel
Arcube ensures the **API integration** preserves the partner’s branding across all touchpoints:

- Colors  
- Fonts  
- Logos  
- Layouts  

When ancillaries are displayed within the partner’s system, the **look and feel** align with the airline or TMC’s visual identity and design standards, delivering a seamless, cohesive user experience.

## Payment Flow

## Security Considerations
- **API Authentication** – Enforced via API keys or JWT tokens to ensure secure access.  
- **Data Encryption** – All API calls are transmitted over HTTPS for data protection.  
- **Privacy Compliance** – Only anonymized passenger data is exchanged to comply with GDPR and similar regulations.
